# Homeostasis
This repository contains the MATLAB and SINGULAR code for the mathematical analysis and associated figures in the publication "Robust Homeostasis of Cellular CHolesterol via Antithetic Control", submitted for review to the journal Fronties in Cell and Developmental Biology.

Authors: Ronel Scheepers and Robyn P. Araujo, May 2023, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.

The numerical analysis in Section 4.3 was performed on data generated using the files labelled as StabilityOriginalParameters.mlx and StabilityRandomParameters.mlx respectively while the MATLAB script Chol_Input_Tiled.m generated the Figures 4a - 4d.


The code listings for analysing RPA in the cholesterol concentration of the plasma membrane (Cp), the free cholesterol (Cf) and esterified cholesterol (E) is provided in the SingularRPA_Cp.pdf, Singular_Cf.pdf and Singular_E.pdf files respectively.
