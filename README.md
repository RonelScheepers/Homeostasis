# Homeostasis
This repository contains the MATLAB code for the mathematical analysis and associated figures in the publication "Robust Homeostasis of Cellular CHolesterol via Antithetic Control", submitted for review to the journal Fronties in Cell and Developmental Biology.

Authors: Ronel Scheepers and Robyn P. Araujo, May 2023, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.

The numerical analysis in Section 4.3 was performed on data generated using the file StabilityCholRandom.mxl for varing conditions (see code documentation), while the MATLAB script Chol_Input_Tiled generated the Figures 4a - 4d.
